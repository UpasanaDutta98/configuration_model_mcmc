This code package builds upon the Double Edge Swap MCMC Graph Sampler by Fosdick et al. [1] . It detects convergence in the Double Edge Swap MCMC and samples networks from the MCMC's stationary distribution, so that the samples are uniform random draws from the Configuration model. [1] Bailey K. Fosdick, Daniel B. Larremore, Joel Nishimura, Johan Ugander (2018) Configuring Random Graph Models with Fixed Degree Sequences. SIAM Review 60(2):315\u2013355. Why use configuration_model_mcmc? The configuration_model function of the networkx package in Python works best only for the loopy multigraph space because the graph returned is a pseudograph, i.e., the graph is allowed to have self-loops and parallel edges(multi-edges). Often times practitioners remove the self-loops and collapse the multi-edges in the network returned by the function to get a simple network , but this modification changes the degree sequence of the network. It also introduces a bias in the network generating process because the high-degree nodes are more likely to have self-loops and multi-edges attached to them than are the low-degree nodes. Therefore, the network generated is a biased sample. The configuration_model_mcmc package lets you sample an unbiased sample from the Configuration model on eight different graph spaces parameterized by self-loops/no self-loops, multi-edges/no multi-edges and stub-labeled/vertex-labeled. Installing pip install configuration_model_mcmc This package supports Python 3.7 and 3.8, and requires the packages Numpy>=1.17.1, Networkx>=2.4, Scipy>=1.4.1, Numba==0.49.1. These dependencies are automatically installed while installing the package. s Notes The package will not work for weighted networks, directed networks, hypergraphs, or simplical complexes.
